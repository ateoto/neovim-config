## About

My neovim configuration, based on the excellent [Neovim From Scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) series by chris@machine.

## Prereqs

This will be tracking latest Neovim as I enjoy all the bells and whistles coming from that project.

* neovim >= 0.7

LSPs will require certain dev toolchains to be installed, I primarily use Python, and Go, but a lot of the language servers unfortunately require a javascript runtime and all the associated tooling there.
